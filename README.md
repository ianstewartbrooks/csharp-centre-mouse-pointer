# csharp-centre-mouse-pointer
A simple c# console app that centres the mouse pointer on the screen that the mouse is currently on. 

Being registered blind (I have just 10% eyesight with glasses) I constantly lose the mouse pointer when using my PC so I wrote a small C# console application that centres the pointer on the currently used screen. I then compiled the app and bound it to a spare button on my mouse using the Logitech software so now I can easily centre the pointer with a simple click!

The app could aslo be bound to a key on the keyboard using something like AutoHotKey.

I hope this helps someone out.
