# csharp-centre-mouse-pointer
A simple c# console app that centres the mouse pointer on the screen that the mouse is currently on. 

Being registered blind (I have just 10% eyesight with glasses) I constantly lose the mouse pointer when using my PC so I knocked up a quick C# console application that centres the pointer on the currently used screen. I then compiled the app and bound it to a spare button on my mouse so now when I lose the pointer I can clickly centre it on my screen!

I hope this helps someone out.
